# Security Implementation for CI/CD Pipeline

This document describes the security measures implemented to protect secrets and sensitive data in the GitHub Actions workflows.

## Security Requirements

Based on the LLM translation system specification, the following security measures have been implemented:

### 1. PR Event Secrets Guard

**Requirement**: `GEMINI_API_KEY` should only be used in Actions Secrets and never in PR events.

**Implementation**:
- Added explicit guards in `sync.yml` and `sync-upstream.yml` workflows
- Workflows with secrets will not run on `pull_request` or `pull_request_target` events
- Test workflow (`security-test.yml`) validates this behavior

### 2. Variable Scoping

**Requirement**: Organize CI variable scope and minimize logging exposure.

**Implementation**:
- Environment variables with secrets are scoped to specific steps only
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` is now scoped to the PR creation step only
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` is scoped to the translation execution step only

### 3. Log Minimization

**Requirement**: Minimize logging of sensitive information.

**Implementation**:
- Filtered output from translation process to show only important messages
- Detailed logs are saved to artifacts instead of being displayed in job logs
- Log summaries show counts rather than full content
- Sensitive variable validation does not expose values

## Security Tests

The `security-test.yml` workflow runs on every PR to validate:

1. **Secrets Accessibility Test**: Confirms secrets are not accessible in PR events
2. **Workflow Analysis Test**: Parses workflows to ensure proper guards are in place
3. **Variable Scoping Test**: Validates environment variable isolation

## Workflow Security Matrix

| Workflow | Uses Secrets | PR Triggers | Security Status |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| `test-deploy.yml` | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ✅ Safe |
| `deploy.yml` | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Safe |
| `sync.yml` | ✅ Yes | ❌ No + Guards | ✅ Protected |
| `sync-upstream.yml` | ✅ Yes | ❌ No + Guards | ✅ Protected |
| `security-test.yml` | ❌ No (Test Only) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Safe |

## Secret Management

### Required Secrets

- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Used for LLM translation service
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatically provided by GitHub Actions

### Security Controls

1. **Access Control**: Secrets are only accessible in scheduled/manual workflows
2. **Event Guards**: Explicit conditions prevent secret access in PR events  
3. **Scope Limitation**: Environment variables are scoped to minimal required steps
4. **Audit Trail**: Security tests run on every PR to validate compliance

## Monitoring

The security implementation includes:

- Automated testing on every PR
- Workflow parsing to detect security anti-patterns
- Variable scoping validation
- Log filtering to prevent information leakage

## Compliance

This implementation satisfies the security requirements specified in:
- `tools/spec.md` section 11 (セキュリティ/可用性)
- Issue requirements for PR event secrets guard
- CI variable scope organization
- Log minimization requirements
